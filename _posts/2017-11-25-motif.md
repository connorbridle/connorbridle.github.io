# H1 Protein Motif Search Tool
During a final year module at university, I was tasked to produce an application that Bioinformatists could use to search amyloid protein sequences for a specific pattern that is known to cause neurodegenerative  diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.

The following Prosite pattern motif was suspected by researchers to form these amyloid associations which in turn led to the neurodegenerative diseases:

$${P}_1-{PKRHW}_2-[VLSWFNQ]_3-[ILTYWFN]_4-[FIY]_5-{PKRH}_6$$ "[]_"

The design decided upon was a website based application, which in my opinion is much better suited to the intended audience. The front-end website would deal with all the user input options whilst keeping a clean and minimalist design to ensure accessibility for all levels of technical literacy. The backend of the service consisted of a Python script that would perform some operations on the users inputted value, and then feed the results back to the HTML document for the user to view.

I was awarded a mark of 94/100 for the web-tool.
