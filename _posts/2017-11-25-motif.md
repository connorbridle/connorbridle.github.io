# H1 Protein Motif Search Tool
During a final year module at university, I was tasked to produce an application that Bioinformatists could use to search amyloid protein sequences for a specific pattern that is known to cause neurodegenerative  diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.

The following Prosite pattern motif was suspected by researchers to form these amyloid associations which in turn led to the neurodegenerative diseases:
$${P}_1-{PKRHW}_2-[VLSWFNQ]_3-[ILTYWFN]_4-[FIY]_5-{PKRH}_6$$

I was awarded a mark of 94 for the web-tool.
